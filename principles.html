                  <li>1) Minimization: Minimization’s goal is to simplify and decrease the number of ways the software can be hacked.</li>

<h3>A. The less doors in a building, the less places to break in.</h3>

<li>2) Simplicity: If something is less complicated, it’s less likely to have problems and easier to troubleshoot and fix.</li>

<h3>A. Bicycle versus a Car.</h3>

<li>3) Abstraction: A fancy word for summarizing or explaining in a way that can be easily understood.</li>

<h3>A. 2 x 3 is the same as 2+2+2</h3>

<li>4) Data Hiding: Any attempt to prevent people from being able to see information.</li>

<h3>A. Keeping cards and money in a wallet, a diary with a lock, secret notes to friends, special hiding places.</h3>

<li>5) Least Privilege: Limits what access people have to your resources and what they can do with them.</li>

<h3>A. Keys to a door.</h3>

<li>6) Modularity: Able to be inserted or removed from a project; each module has its own function, interchangeable with other modules.</li>

<h3>A. Wheels on a bicycle or skateboard</h3>

<li>7) Layering: Multiple layers of defense to protect information. If one layer is defeated, the next layer should catch it.</li>

<h3>A.Bank – Cameras, Security Guards, Locks, Vault; Playing an online games: enter the room, defeat the monster, pick the lock, and then gather the treasure.</h3>

<li>8) Resource Encapsulation: Resources – hardware, system objects, or processes – must be separated and used as intended.</li>

<h3>A.You wouldn’t call your doctor if your house was on fire, you would call the fire department (911).</h3>

<li>9) Process Isolation: A process occurs when a task is executed. Keeping processes separate prevents the failure of one process from negatively impacting another.</li>

<h3>A.Don’t text and drive</h3>

<li>10) Domain Separation: Separating areas where resources are located prevents accidents and loss of data, keeping information worlds from colliding.</li>

<h3>A.You do not cover math concepts in gym class. Your teacher doesn’t teach class in his or her house.</h3></p></div>

<h3>Minimize attack surface area: Only have features that are necessary </h3>

<h3>Establish secure defaults: For instance, password aging (making it a requirement to change your password periodically)</h3>

<h3>Least privilege: Make sure there is a hierarchy of power; a new employee shouldn’t have as much access as the owner</h3>

<h3>Defense in depth: This makes sure that if one administrator’s password is compromised, the rest are still safe.</h3>

<h3>Fail securely: Make sure programs don’t fail completely from small problems</h3>

<h3>Don’t trust services: Use little, if any, third party services. They increase the amount of ways your information can be compromised</h3>

<h3>Separation of duties: For example, someone who runs the cloud of a network shouldn’t also have access to the physical computers themselves. This would present a serious security risk</h3>

<h3>Keep security simple: Less is more, in a sense. Avoid having redundant security measures.</h3>

<h3>Fix security issues correctly: When a security flaw is found, be sure to test it, find the root of the problem, then promptly fix the problem.</h3>

<h3>Architects and solution providers need guidance to produce secure applications by design, and they can do this by not only implementing the basic controls documented in the main text, but also referring back to the underlying “Why?” in these principles. Security principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability – although important, broad, and vague – do not change. Your application will be the more robust the more you apply them. For example, it is a fine thing when implementing data validation to include a centralized validation routine for all form input. However, it is a far finer thing to see validation at each tier for all user input, coupled with appropriate error handling and robust access control</h3>

<li>- Disgruntled staff or developers</li>

<li>- Organized criminal organizations</li>

<li>- Defacers</li>

<li>- Main facets of Information Security</li>

<li>- Confidentiality: Only allow people who are authorized to view files view them</li>

<li>- Integrity: Make sure no unauthorized users have access to information</li>

<li>- Availability: Make sure information is always available to those who are authorized</li>

<li>- Questions to ask regarding the security of a new application</li>

<li>- Is this program safe? Is the process safe?</li>

<li>- If I were evil, how might I abuse this program?</li>

<li>- Should I limit this program to only certain people?</li></p>

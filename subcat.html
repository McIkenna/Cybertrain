                <p >Hello, and welcome to a learning adventure about cyber security. Cyber security is much like security in the real world. We must always be aware of our surroundings and understand that there are some that want to use our information, this can include identity theft, credit card theft, as well as an intention of hurting our feelings by saying things that are not nice.

                Please always be aware, and if something doesnt look or fell right, notify an adult so that they may interact. No one should ever ask for your private information such as address, phone number, social security number, or any personal questions about you or your family. Remain aware just as Security Sam and enjoy your experience researching online and learning new and exciting things.</p>
